Weather Dashboard
<br/>
<br/>
This Weather Dashboard app uses a combination of HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and the third party API OpenWeather to fetch weather data and display it in the browser.
<br/>
<br/>
The user is able to type in a city of their choosing and see the current weather data for that city, as well as the projected forecast for the next 5 days. Once a city has been searched, it will appear as a button in the search bar area. When that button is clicked, the browser will once again display the forecast for that city. The user also has the option to clear their search history and refresh the page.
